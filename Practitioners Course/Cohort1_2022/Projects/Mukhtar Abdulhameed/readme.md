## Project Title

#### Background information
Crime is global phenomena that need to be tackled to create an enabling environment for socio-economic development. Crime does not only pose threats to
the lives and properties of citizens, but affect the overall development of a nation. Thus, there is a strong link between crime and   development. 
Globalization has enhanced the connectivity of persons which has enabled criminal elements to organize and perpetrate large-scale crimes. Nigeria has arguably become one of the epicenters of crimes with insecurity rising at an alarming rate in recent years.
Peace and stability have been the core objective of most nations in the world over the years, crimes have continued to remain a major setback
to achieving meaningful socio-economic development in Nigeria. In recent time, Nigeria had continued to witness a tremendous setback in its socio-economic development fuelled by the continuous resurgence of different kinds of crimes threats particularly armed banditry, kidnapping, terrorism, maritime crime, human trafficking, drugs trafficking, fire arms trafficking, Cybercrime, grand corruption, wildlife crime among others thereby posing a serious threat to the country’s national security. All the 6 Geo-political zones and 36 States in Nigeria are facing different types of crimes and Nigerian government have spent over ₦462 trillion on national security over the past five years. The governments’ effort to bring the menace to a standstill to avoid total possible breakdown of law and order seems not to have yielded the desired positive result.
